My brother is currently transforming an old public transport bus in to a house, and wants to light everything with ledstrips. He asked me to design a system that could do the following:

1. Push a light swicht shortly, and the lights should toggle
2. Push and hold a light and the light should start dimming untill you release the switch
3. There should be a wake up light mode

# The hardware

![The dimascus controll board design](/projects/images/dimascus-board.png)

As most of my projects the board is built around an atmega8 --- The are just so dirt cheap, and the arduino bootloader allows other people to thinker with the software later on. The inputs are fed through a bank of optocouplers to eliminate EMI, and at the outputs there are a bunch of mosfets to directly drive the led strips. The board was milled in [fablab brussels][bxl].

A crappy shot of the populated board.

# The software

To enable the wake up light mode: send a pulse to the wake up light pin, the slected led strips will than start to slowly fade.
Appart from the requested features I addes some more:
1. An all of pin: send a pulse to this pin, and all lights are turned off
2. A party mode pin: send a pulse to this pin, and all lights start to hystericaly flicker

# Status
2014-08-15: The system is ready and awaiting installation. After the installation the software will be tweaked a bit.

# More info

The software and schematics are  on [github][]
