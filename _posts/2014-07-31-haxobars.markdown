At [haxogreen][] the hackcenter (main tent) was lit with eurolite RGBA bars. GMC had an [Art-Net to DMX box][artnetbox] from [ohm2013][] with him, so we had no other choice but to wire up a DMX512 universe and make some super annoying blinking scripts.

# Basic structure
A couple of classes were used:

* Effect: A superclass for effects
    * Dimmer: A class to make lights slowly fade towards a certain color
* Mapper: To map the software address of the lights to their DMX hardware address
* Light: A superclass for fixtures (should be renamed ad some point)
    * Parl40: A class for a specific spot fixture
    * Eurospot: idem
    * City: A class for city floodlights
    * Bar: A class for the man RGBA lights that were in the tent
* Camp: A class to sit on top of everything else and store what lights we have, and what there addresses are
* Sender: A simple class to send out basic DMX packages, mainly used for debugging
