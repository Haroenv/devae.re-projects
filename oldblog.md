# Just one more click ...

Hi, you visited to blog.devae.re, but I have moved from wordpress to something static, and I haven't bother to set up proper redirects (yet).
But there were only four projects on the blog when I moved, so you are probably looking for one of there:

* [Janus the gatekeep]\: my hacked front gate / doorbel
* [Netlight]\: The network monitoring device we made for haxogreen2012
* [Electricity timer]\: A system to motivate donating to a free festival
* [The final countdown]\: A clockface to cound down to the end of higschool
